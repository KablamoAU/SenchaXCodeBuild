SenchaXCodeBuild
================

Build script for Sencha 2.1 with XCode 

Run this from your master branch, it will create a release branch, build sencha, remove build files, commit and push to git. Great for automated build processes.

I usually run this from the phonegap xcode/project/www folder. eg. preprel . RelV1.0.X

You can integrate this into jenkins with little effort.
